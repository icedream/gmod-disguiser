-- Disguiser SWEP - Lets you disguise as any prop on a map.
--
-- File:
--   patch_createfont.lua
--
-- Purpose:
--   This code will allow any font to be checked for existence. I hope it works
--   as it is only a function patch which should be loaded right at the beginning.
--   Can't guarantee that it loads right at the beginning though.
